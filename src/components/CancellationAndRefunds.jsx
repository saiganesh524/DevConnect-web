              SAI GANESH KANDULA believes in helping its customers as far as

              <li className="leading-8">
                Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made
                within 7 days of placing the order. However, the cancellation
                request may not be entertained if the orders have been
                communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated
                the process of shipping them.

                SAI GANESH does not accept cancellation requests for perishable
                items like flowers, eatables etc. However, refund/replacement
                can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of
                product delivered is not good.

                In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report
                the same to our Customer Service team. The request will,
                however, be entertained once the merchant has checked and
                determined the same at his own end. This should be reported
                within 7 days of receipt of the products.
